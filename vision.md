- in the world of nfts i belive that code or rather executables from developers must also be tokensied into nft like onjects
- this repo is an exploratin of this idea
- what i strive to make here is aprotocol onpot of the etherium chain that can be used by open source programmers to shell out their code to the world without being bogged down by corprorate motivations for profit
- we want to make every developer be able to monotize their work, while maintaining the goals of being open source
